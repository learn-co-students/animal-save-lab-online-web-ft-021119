html {
  background: url(../images/spice-girls.jpg) no-repeat top left;

#monkey {
  position: absolute;
  top: 550px;
  right: 120px;
}

/* Write your solution here */


@media (max-width: 1192px) and (min-width: 600px) {
  #monkey {
    top: -50px;
  }
}



or the monkey, use a combination of min-width and max-width to set a media query that will allow the monkey to jump up over the Spice Girls from screen size of 406px to 1170px keeping him safe from their affection.
